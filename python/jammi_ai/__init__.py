"""Jammi AI — embeddable inference engine for structured data.

The **develop** half of the develop→deploy journey: a compiled, in-process
engine (the `_native` extension) plus the bundled pure-Python `jammi-client` for
remote targets. One `connect(target)` is the single front door — the Python
mirror of the Rust `Jammi::open(Target)` — where transport is config, not a code
path:

* ``connect("file:///data")`` → the compiled local engine (`_native`).
* ``connect("https://host")`` / ``"grpc://host:8081"`` → the bundled
  `jammi-client`, by composition. The remote surface is DEFINED ONCE, in
  `jammi-client`; `jammi-ai`'s remote IS `jammi-client`'s, so the two agree by
  construction rather than by a parallel reimplementation.

Scaling local→remote is an env flip (``connect(os.environ["JAMMI_TARGET"])``)
with no code change; productionising to the lean client is a one-line import
swap (``import jammi_ai`` → ``import jammi_client``), `connect` unchanged.
