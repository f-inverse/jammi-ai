//!   produces embeddings via its own (frozen) forward; the head shifts them.
//!   Works with any [`crate::model::LoadedModel`] backbone.
//! - [`TrainingTarget::EncoderAdapters`] — LoRA is injected into the encoder's
//!   internal attention/FFN linears via [`jammi_encoders::AnyEncoder`].
//!   Requires a jammi-encoders-supported architecture (BERT family).
//!
//! The two variants share no on-disk discriminator at the safetensors level —
