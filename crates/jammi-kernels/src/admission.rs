//! Runtime admission scaffolding shared by every fused op's call site: a
//! CUDA compute-capability probe, per-op fused/eager dispatch counters, a
//! log-once-per-process WARN helper, and a `Strict` mode that turns a failed
//! domain check into a hard error instead of a silent fallback.
//!
//! This module contains no fusion POLICY (no op decides here whether it
//! *should* fuse) — it is the shared mechanism a call site's own domain
//! check (dtype, shape, contiguity, device capability) reports its outcome
//! through, so every op's fallback is observable the same way.
